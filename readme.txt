== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the login and password input field appear when I try to go to PhpMyAdmin or Dumper, but if I try to enter my data it says that they are incorrect? = 

It is the work of the browser's cache which is unfortunately not cleared by force (it is necessary to re-open the browser or try again later), this fact causes such an effect - cache loads the data, but in fact they are not the same. All you need is to click "Cancel" in the pop-up window and follow the link to the downloaded system of PhpMyAdmin or Dumper.
